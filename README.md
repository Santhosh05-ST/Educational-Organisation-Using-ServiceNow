Educational Organisation Using ServiceNow
Project Overview
This project demonstrates how ServiceNow can be used to streamline and automate processes in an educational organisation.
Currently, many institutions handle admissions, student records, and progress manually, which causes delays, errors, and poor tracking.

Our solution provides a digital platform that manages:

Student admissions
Student & parent details
Automated admission numbers
Progress calculation (marks, percentage, results)
Structured workflows
